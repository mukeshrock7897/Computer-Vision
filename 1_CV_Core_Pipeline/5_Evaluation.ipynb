    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Accuracy** → overall correctness (good for classification)\n",
    "* 🎯 **Precision / Recall** → balance false positives & false negatives\n",
    "* ⚖️ **F1-Score** → harmonic mean of precision & recall\n",
    "* 📐 **IoU (Intersection over Union)** → overlap of predicted vs. true boxes (detection/segmentation)\n",
    "* 🏆 **mAP (mean Average Precision)** → gold standard for object detection\n",
    "* ⚡ **FPS (Frames per Second)** → speed for real-time systems\n",

    "## ✅ Quick Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* 👉 Pick metrics based on **task** (classification vs detection vs segmentation)\n",
    "* 👉 IoU & mAP = essential for bounding box tasks 🎯\n",
    "* 👉 Accuracy alone is not enough in CV 🚫\n",
