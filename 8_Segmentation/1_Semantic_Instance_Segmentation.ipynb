    "## 📌 Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧩 **Semantic Segmentation** → classify each pixel into categories (car 🚗, road 🛣️, tree 🌳)\n",
    "* 🧍 **Instance Segmentation** → distinguish between different objects of the same type (two cars 🚗🚗 separately)\n",

    "## 📌 Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🏥 **U-Net** → medical image segmentation (X-rays, MRI scans)\n",
    "* 🖼️ **DeepLab (v3/v3+)** → strong semantic segmentation with atrous convolutions\n",
    "* 🎯 **Mask R-CNN** → combines detection + segmentation for instances\n",

    "## ✅ Quick Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* 👉 Semantic = what category is each pixel 🎨\n",
    "* 👉 Instance = separate objects of the same category 🧍🧍\n",
    "* 👉 Critical for autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics ⚡\n",
